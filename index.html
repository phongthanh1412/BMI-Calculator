        <h1>BMI Calculator</h1>
        <p>
          BMI (body mass index) is a tool for adults that helps determine if your weight falls into
          the underweight, healthy, or overweight categories relative to your height. Essentially, the BMI calculation
          provides a quick snapshot of how your weight compares to typical values. It's calculated by taking your
          weight in kilograms and dividing it by the square of your height in meters BMI = weight/height<sup>2</sup>.
          This simple formula gives you an idea of whether your weight is generally in a healthy range for your
          height.

        <h3>Underweight</h3>
        <p>
          Being underweight can lead to a deficiency in essential nutrients, impacting your skin, hair,
          and teeth, and causing fatigue. Women, in particular, might experience irregular menstrual cycles
          and an increased risk of osteoporosis. It's recommended to consult your doctor to understand the
          cause of your low BMI and to develop a healthy weight gain plan.

        <h3>Healthy weight</h3>
        <p>
          While a healthy BMI suggests you're at an appropriate weight for your height, it does not offer
          a complete picture of your body's composition, like your muscle-to-fat ratio, activity levels,
          or body type. Therefore, it's essential to monitor your overall health, diet, exercise habits,
          and any weight fluctuations.

        <h3>Overweight</h3>
        <p>
          Having a BMI in the overweight range can significantly increase your risk of developing several
          serious health conditions. You might be more susceptible to chronic diseases like type 2 diabetes,
          which affects how your body processes sugar, and heart disease, a broad term for conditions that
          affect your heart and blood vessels. Additionally, being overweight can elevate your chances of
          developing gallstones, hardened deposits in your gallbladder, and even certain types of cancer.

        <p>
          A BMI of 30 or higher signals obesity, significantly raising your risk for serious health issues.
          This includes a much higher chance of developing heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain
          cancers. It's crucial to discuss these risks with your doctor to find ways to manage your weight and improve
          your health.

      <p>
        While BMI is generally a useful way to gauge a healthy weight, it's not a perfect fit for everyone.
        Certain individuals should view their BMI results with caution, and for some, the measurement might
        not be helpful at all.

          <h3>Children</h3>
          <p>
            For children and young people aged 2 to 18, BMI calculation differs significantly from adults. This
            is because children are still growing, and boys and girls develop at varying rates. A specialized
            children's BMI calculator takes into account age, children, height, and weight. The result is presented as a
            "centile" number. This centile indicates how a child's BMI compares to other children of the same age and
            children.
            For example, if a boy is on the 60th centile, it means he is heavier than 60 out of 100 other boys his
            age.

        <article class="card age">
          <h3>Old people</h3>
          <p>
            As we age, our bodies naturally undergo changes, including an increase in fat mass and a decrease in
            muscle mass. Because of this shift in body composition, the BMI (Body Mass Index), which primarily considers
            weight and height, may not be a truly reliable indicator of health or body fat for individuals over 60. It's
            important to remember that for older adults, other factors beyond just BMI might offer a clearer picture of
            their
            overall health and well-being.

        <article class="card muscle">
          <h3>Muscular people</h3>
          <p>
            BMI can be misleading for very muscular individuals, like weight trainers and athletes. Since muscle
            weighs more than fat, highly muscled people might register as obese on the BMI scale even when they are, in
            fact, at a
            healthy weight for their body composition.

        <article class="card pregnancy">
          <h3>Pregnant women</h3>
          <p>
            When pregnant, it's natural to gain weight due to your growing baby and the surrounding amniotic fluid.
            This makes it challenging to pinpoint your "true" pre-pregnancy weight. If you have concerns about your
            weight during
            pregnancy, it's best to consult your midwife or GP.

            Some individuals of Black and Asian descent may face health risks at lower BMI levels compared to other
            groups. If this is a concern for you, it's a good idea to speak with your GP or practice nurse for more
            information.
