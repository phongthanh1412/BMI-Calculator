          <h1>BMI Calculator</h1>
          <p>
            BMI (body mass index) is a tool for adults that helps determine if your weight falls into
            the underweight, healthy, or overweight categories relative to your height. Essentially, the BMI calculation
            provides a quick snapshot of how your weight compares to typical values. It's calculated by taking your
            weight
            in kilograms and dividing it by the square of your height in meters BMI = weight/height<sup>2</sup>.
            This simple formula gives you an idea of whether your weight is generally in a healthy range for your
            height.

            <h3>Underweight</h3>
            <p>
              Being underweight can lead to a deficiency in essential nutrients, impacting your skin, hair,
              and teeth, and causing fatigue. Women, in particular, might experience irregular menstrual cycles
              and an increased risk of osteoporosis. It's recommended to consult your doctor to understand the
              cause of your low BMI and to develop a healthy weight gain plan.

            <h3>Healthy weight</h3>
            <p>
              While a healthy BMI suggests you're at an appropriate weight for your height, it does not offer
              a complete picture of your body's composition, like your muscle-to-fat ratio, activity levels,
              or body type. Therefore, it's essential to monitor your overall health, diet, exercise habits,
              and any weight fluctuations.

            <h3>Overweight</h3>
            <p>
              Having a BMI in the overweight range can significantly increase your risk of developing several
              serious health conditions. You might be more susceptible to chronic diseases like type 2 diabetes,
              which affects how your body processes sugar, and heart disease, a broad term for conditions that
              affect your heart and blood vessels. Additionally, being overweight can elevate your chances of
              developing gallstones, hardened deposits in your gallbladder, and even certain types of cancer.

            <h3>Obesity</h3>
            <p>
              A BMI of 30 or higher signals obesity, significantly raising your risk for serious health issues.
              This includes a much higher chance of developing heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain
              cancers.
              It's crucial to discuss these risks with your doctor to find ways to manage your weight and improve
              your health.

          <h2>Specific cases where BMI may not apply</h2>
          <p>
            While BMI is generally a useful way to gauge a healthy weight, it's not a perfect fit for everyone.
            Certain individuals should view their BMI results with caution, and for some, the measurement might
            not be helpful at all.

            <p>
              For children and young people aged 2 to 18, BMI calculation differs significantly from adults. This
              is because children are still growing, and boys and girls develop at varying rates. A specialized
              children's
              BMI calculator takes into account age, children, height, and weight. The result is presented as a
              "centile"
              number. This centile indicates how a child's BMI compares to other children of the same age and children.
              For example, if a boy is on the 60th centile, it means he is heavier than 60 out of 100 other boys his
              age.

            <p>
              As we age, our bodies naturally undergo changes, including an increase in fat mass and a decrease in
              muscle
              mass. Because of this shift in body composition, the BMI (Body Mass Index), which primarily considers
              weight
              and height, may not be a truly reliable indicator of health or body fat for individuals over 60. It's
              important
              to remember that for older adults, other factors beyond just BMI might offer a clearer picture of their
              overall
              health and well-being.

            </div>
            <p>
              BMI can be misleading for very muscular individuals, like weight trainers and athletes. Since muscle
              weighs more
              than fat, highly muscled people might register as obese on the BMI scale even when they are, in fact, at a
              healthy
              weight for their body composition.

              When pregnant, it's natural to gain weight due to your growing baby and the surrounding amniotic fluid.
              This makes
              it challenging to pinpoint your "true" pre-pregnancy weight. If you have concerns about your weight during
              pregnancy
              , it's best to consult your midwife or GP.

              Healthy eating isn't just about managing your weight; it's a cornerstone of overall well-being.
              It helps prevent diseases, improves digestion, strengthens your immune system, and even boosts

              Routine exercise is a powerful tool for your health. It not only boosts your fitness and helps
              with weight management, but also significantly improves your mood and lowers your risk of disease,

              for your body and mind.
